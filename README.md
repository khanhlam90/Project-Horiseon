# Code Refactor Starter Code
Given the project Horiseon, the goal for the project is to follow the client's mock-up. However, the project itself needs to be cleaned up, and the following details were done:
a. Source code with semantic HTML elements
b. The HTML follows the logical structure, independent of styling and possitioning
c. All images include accessible alt attributes
d. Heading attributes follow the sequential order
e. The HTML has the concise title
f. All <e> links function properly
g. CSS file was properly consolidated and commented, however, without chaning the client's mock-up
